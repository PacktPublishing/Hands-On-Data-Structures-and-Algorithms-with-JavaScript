# Hands-On Data Structures and Algorithms with JavaScript
This is the code repository for [Hands-On Data Structures and Algorithms with JavaScript](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/hands-data-structures-and-algorithms-javascript?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788398558), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
The main focus of this book is employing data structures and algorithms in real-world web applications using JavaScript.

With JavaScript making its way onto the server side and with Single Page Application (SPA) frameworks taking over the client side, a lot, if not all, of the business logic, is being ported over to the client side. This makes it crucial to employ hand-crafted data structures and algorithms that are tailor-made for a given use case.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

The screenshots in this book are taken on a macOS. There would be little difference (if any) for users of any other OS. The code samples, however, would run without any discrepancies irrespective of the OS. Anywhere we have CMD/cmd/command specified, please use CTRL/ctrl/control key on the windows counterpart. If you see return, please use Enter and if you see the term terminal/Terminal please use its equivalent command prompt on windows. 
In this book, the code base is built incrementally as the topic progresses. So, when you compare the beginning of a code sample with the code base in GitHub, be aware that the GitHub code is the final form of the topic or the example that you are referring to.

The code will look like the following:
```
var express = require('express');
var app = express();
var data = require('./books.json');
var Insertion = require('./sort/insertion');
```

Basic knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
Have Node.js installed (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
Install WebStorm IDE (https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download) or similar
A next-generation browser such as Google Chrome (https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/)
Familiarity with Angular 2.0 or greater is a plus but is not required
